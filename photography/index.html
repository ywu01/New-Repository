			<p>I'm a rising senior at Harvard majoring in Economics and Computer Science. I interned at Zinc, a Y-Combinator backed e-commerce startup, last summer and currently will be back in the Bay Area for the summer of 2016. During this year's spring semester, I've worked along with Daniel Wu and a few others on their President's Challenge entry, WelcomeHome, which got to the final round. I've also been a photographer for Kirkland House for the past two years and have served as a multimedia executive for The Harvard Crimson between my sophomore/junior years.</p>
			
			<p>I'm interested in the intersection of business, product, and design. My resume offers some additional details.</p>

			<h4>KIRKLAND HOUSE</h4>
				<p>I've been the house photographer for the past three years. Some of them are included in my portfolio, accessible below.</p>
			<h4>WELCOMEHOME</h4>
				<p>An entry into the Harvard President's Challenge, we ended up with finalist status. We also ended up with semi-finalist status on MIT100k. We plan to continue developing this idea and deploy a prototype in the Fall of 2016. <a href="http://www.welcomehome.city/#!renters-1/nbgy0" style="font-size:20px">welcomehome.city</a></p>
			<h4>THE HARVARD CRIMSON</h4>
				<p>I was an executive for the multimedia board for a year, and now participate casually as a JE. I've had hundreds of photos published for this student-run publication throughout my three years there. Pageviews run in the millions annually for the website; I am currently working on an online design leading up to the 2016 Commencement. <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/" style="font-size:20px">thecrimson.com</a></p> 
			<h4>ZINC TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
				<p>As a business analyst, I did a mix of business development, marketing, sales, and support. Typical for a company of small size, as was the case with Zinc. Specifically worked with support for PriceYak, an automatic repricer, and growth for JoeLister. <a href="https://zinc.io/" style="font-size:20px">zinc.io</a></p>
			<h4>DATA VIZ</h4>
				<p>The final project for CS171, a course about data visualization. This particular visualization draws data from the Spotify API, and creates a visual network of artists based on an initial query. Double clicking nodes will lead you to the artist at that particular node; using the toolbar in the middle will also allow you to shuffle, play different songs, and navigate. Worked in a team of three. <a href="http://cwjshen.github.io/7-Degrees-of-Maroon-5/" style="font-size:20px">Hosted on Github.</a></p>
