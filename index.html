			<p> I'm a senior at Harvard majoring in Economics and minoring in Computer Science. I interned at <a href="http://zinc.io" target="_blank">Zinc</a> my sophomore summer and <a href="http://emberlight.co" target="_blank">emberlight</a> the summer after that. During junior year, I worked with Daniel Wu and a few others on a President's Challenge entry, <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/03/presidents-challenge-narrows-field-to-10-finalists/" target="_blank">WelcomeHome</a>, which made it to the final round. I thought that was pretty cool.
			</p>
			<p> 
			Besides the tech/startup environment, I've also been a photographer for <a href="http://kirkland.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Kirkland House</a> for the past two years. That originally overlaped with a multimedia stint at <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1210590/Y._Kit_Wu/" target="_blank">The Harvard Crimson</a>, but I have since settled for a more flexible role at the House. 
			</p>
			<p> 
			I'm interested in the intricacies of great products, and how they're designed, built, and released into the wild. My resume offers some additional details about that and my previous work.

			<div id="intro" class="collapse">
				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">KIRKLAND HOUSE.</span>I've been the house photographer for the past three years. Some of them are included in my portfolio, accessible below.</p>
<!-- 			<h4>EMBERLIGHT</h4> -->
				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">EMBERLIGHT.</span>Emberlight is an internet-of-things startup that grew out of a 300k Kickstarter campaign. In contrast to the smaller role I took at Zinc, I ran most of the marketing operations/content production for the two months I was present. Beyond marketing, I also assisted with some operations related tasks coming out from Amazon.</p>
			<!-- <h4>WELCOMEHOME</h4> -->
				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">WELCOMEHOME.</span>An entry into the Harvard President's Challenge, WelcomeHome was a question about the viability of microliving in large, urban US cities. My role involved a lot of value proposition validation, spanning from interviews inside university dining halls to landing page mockups. We ended up with finalist status. We also ended up with semi-finalist status on MIT100k.</p>
			<!-- <h4>THE HARVARD CRIMSON</h4> -->
				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">THE CRIMSON.</span>I was an executive for the multimedia board for a year, and now participate casually as a JE. I've had a few hundred of photos published for this student-run publication throughout my three years there. Pageviews run in the millions annually for the website; beyond photos, I've previously worked on a HTML/CSS implementation of a blockquote format in liquid.</p> 
			<!-- <h4>ZINC TECHNOLOGIES</h4> -->
				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">ZINC.</span>Zinc is an e-commerce startup that came out of YC's Winter 2015 batch. As a business analyst, I did a mix of business development, marketing, sales, and support. This was my first internship, and I took it in as a good introduction to business roles in startups. <a href="https://zinc.io/">zinc.io</a></p>
			<!-- <h4>DATA VISUALIZATION</h4> -->
				<!-- <img src="http://ywu01.github.io/D3.JPG"> -->
				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">DATA VISUALIZATION.</span>The final project for CS171, a course about data visualization. This particular visualization draws data from the Spotify API, and creates a visual network of artists based on an initial query. Double clicking nodes will lead you to the artist at that particular node; using the toolbar in the middle will also allow you to shuffle, play different songs, and navigate. Worked in a team of three. <a href="http://cwjshen.github.io/7-Degrees-of-Maroon-5/">Hosted on Github.</a></p>
