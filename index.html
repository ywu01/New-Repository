				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">KIRKLAND HOUSE.</span> I live in Kirkland House. It's a community of about 300 students spanning from sophomores to seniors. A pretty important part of life here involves a committee that plans every major event that takes place over the course of a year. I work with that committee. As a house photographer, I've documented the biggest happenings for more than two years, and I've built out a media distribution pipeline that spans across multiple channels. I also facilitate organization within the team of photographers here. It's an enjoyable, casual spin on traditional work-study.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">ZINC.</span> Zinc is an e-commerce startup that came out of YC's Winter 2015 batch. I worked here during my sophomore summer. As a biz analyst, I did a mix of business development, marketing, sales, and support. Yet I also gained a lot of domain knowledge about e-commerce through informal, day-to-day chats. You can read more about the details in the resume. <a href="https://zinc.io/">zinc.io</a></p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">EMBERLIGHT.</span> Emberlight is an internet-of-things startup that grew out of a 300k Kickstarter campaign. In contrast to the smaller role I took at Zinc, I ran most of the marketing operations/content production for the two months I was present. Beyond marketing, I also assisted with some operations related tasks coming out from Amazon. You can read more in the notes I took during my time there. <a href="https://medium.com/@ywu01/weeklong-roundup-pre-week-planning-fcebcb2071a5#.xvn4eg8cj">Notes.</a></p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">WELCOMEHOME.</span> An startup/business plan entry into the Harvard President's Challenge, <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/03/presidents-challenge-narrows-field-to-10-finalists/" target="_blank">WelcomeHome</a> was a question about the viability of microliving in large, urban US cities. I did some work validating the initial value proposition. We ended up as a top 10 finalist at Harvard, and a semi-finalist at MIT's 100K. Since Fall 2016, we've since pivoted to a less capital-intensive project.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">THE CRIMSON.</span> The Crimson is an on-campus, student-run college daily newspaper that operates both an online website and print editions. Annual viewership goes into the millions. Here, I held an executive position for the multimedia board, which, not surprisingly, produces all the multimedia content. I learned a lot of teamwork here. As of Senior Spring 2017, I am officially a retired dino.<a href="https://thecrimson.com/">thecrimson.com</a></p> 

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">DATA VISUALIZATION.</span> Not a position, but a final project for a class I took sophomore year. It draws data from the Spotify API and uses D3 to create the network. <a href="http://cwjshen.github.io/7-Degrees-of-Maroon-5/">Hosted on Github.</a></p>
