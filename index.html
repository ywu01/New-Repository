				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">Kirkland House.</span> Kirkland House is a community of about 300 students. An important part of life here involves a committee which plans every major event. I work with that committee as a house photographer; in the past two years, I've documented the biggest happenings and standardized media distribution pipelines. In addition to my own work, I also facilitate organization within the existing media team.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">Zinc.</span> Zinc is an e-commerce startup that came out of YC's Winter 2015 batch. As a business analyst, I did a mix of business development, marketing/sales, and support. A substantial takeaway was the domain knowledge regarding e-commerce, and the organization of smaller scaled startups. <a href="https://zinc.io/">zinc.io</a></p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">Emberlight.</span> Emberlight is an internet-of-things startup that grew out of a 300k Kickstarter campaign. In contrast to the smaller role I took at Zinc, I ran most of the marketing operations/content production for the two months I was present. Beyond marketing, I also assisted with some operations related tasks coming out from Amazon. You can read more in the notes I took during my time there. <a href="https://medium.com/@ywu01/weeklong-roundup-pre-week-planning-fcebcb2071a5#.xvn4eg8cj">Notes.</a></p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">Welcomehome.</span> An startup/business plan entry into the Harvard President's Challenge, <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/03/presidents-challenge-narrows-field-to-10-finalists/" target="_blank">WelcomeHome</a> was a question about the viability of microliving in large, urban US cities. I did some work validating the initial value proposition. We ended up as a top 10 finalist at Harvard, and a semi-finalist at MIT's 100K. </p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">The Harvard Crimson.</span> The Crimson is an on-campus, student-run college daily newspaper that operates both an online website and print editions. Annual viewership goes into the millions. I held an executive position on the Multimedia Board, and learned a lot about teamwork from my years here. <a href="https://thecrimson.com/">thecrimson.com</a></p> 

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">Data Visualization.</span> A final project for a class I took sophomore year. It draws data from the Spotify API and uses D3 to create the network. <a href="http://cwjshen.github.io/7-Degrees-of-Maroon-5/">Hosted on Github.</a></p>
