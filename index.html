				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">KIRKLAND HOUSE.</span> I live in Kirkland House. It's a community of about 300 students spanning from sophomores to seniors. You might have heard of it because Mark Zuckerberg lived here for a few months, or you might not. Doesn't really matter. A pretty important part of the house community involves a committee that plans every major event that takes place here, and I work with that committee as a house photographer. I've documented the biggest happenings for more than two years, and this year I'm tasked with recruiting the next batch of house photographers and negotiating pay. I've also established a new workflow suited for social media engagement. It's an enjoyable, casual responsibility.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">ZINC.</span> Zinc is an e-commerce startup that came out of YC's Winter 2015 batch. I worked here during my sophomore summer. As a biz analyst, I did a mix of business development, marketing, sales, and support. Yet I also gained a lot of domain knowledge about e-commerce through informal, day-to-day chats. You can read more about the details in the resume. <a href="https://zinc.io/">zinc.io</a></p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">EMBERLIGHT.</span> Emberlight is an internet-of-things startup that grew out of a 300k Kickstarter campaign. In contrast to the smaller role I took at Zinc, I ran most of the marketing operations/content production for the two months I was present. Beyond marketing, I also assisted with some operations related tasks coming out from Amazon. You can read more in the notes I took during my time there. <a href="https://medium.com/@ywu01/weeklong-roundup-pre-week-planning-fcebcb2071a5#.xvn4eg8cj">Notes.</a></p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">WELCOMEHOME.</span> An entry into the Harvard President's Challenge, <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/03/presidents-challenge-narrows-field-to-10-finalists/" target="_blank">WelcomeHome</a> was a question about the viability of microliving in large, urban US cities. I did some work validating the initial value proposition, such as interviewing subjects inside dining halls and making landing page mockups. We ended up with finalist status. We also ended up with semi-finalist status on MIT100k.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">THE CRIMSON.</span> The Crimson is an on-campus, student-run college daily newspaper that operates both an online website and print editions. Annual viewership goes into the millions. Here, I held an executive position for the multimedia board, which, not surprisingly, produces all the multimedia content. I learned how to deal with people and conflicts within teams during my stint and now hold a senior, non-official junior editor position. <a href="https://thecrimson.com/">thecrimson.com</a></p> 

				<p><span style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 33px; color:#990000;">DATA VISUALIZATION.</span> Just to round things off, here's my final project for CS171, a course about data visualization. This particular visualization draws data from the Spotify API, and creates a visual network of artists based on an initial query. Double clicking nodes will lead you to the artist at that particular node; using the toolbar in the middle will also allow you to shuffle, play different songs, and navigate. Worked in a team of three and was responsible for a lot of the front-end design. <a href="http://cwjshen.github.io/7-Degrees-of-Maroon-5/">Hosted on Github.</a></p>
