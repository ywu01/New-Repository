		Well, here I am again. I’m a senior at Harvard concentrating in Economics, and I’ve already applied to this position a few months ago. In fact, I interviewed on the phone with Travis. I suppose you can deduce the result of that conversation by the existence of this application. 
		<br><br>
		Nonetheless, I remain unfazed. I still believe that LiveRamp, for what it’s worth, is something I still should pursue in spite of my past history.  
		<br><br>
		I met Tuyet Cam not too long ago. We were both in San Francisco, and she happened to be a Product Manager at LiveRamp. Here she was – Harvard, Class of 2014, psychology concentrator – and right out of university, a Product Manager. That is what I aspire to be. She displayed dedication for the role. She familiarized herself with material beyond her academic scope. And for that, she was rewarded. She’s been at LiveRamp ever since. 
		<br><br>
		Oh, if only it was that simple for me.  
		<br><br>
		I’ve got my mix of skills and experiences. I’ve done marketing at startups, and TERM is a natural fit for that experience. The rotational program allows me to take the holistic approach I had in small, well-knit teams, and apply that to the varied responsibilities of a larger organization. But that’s secondary to the people: judging from the individuals I’ve met who worked at LiveRamp, this is a company that’s bustling with excellence. This is a place where people know what they’re doing, and those who don’t will try as hard as they can to get up to speed and perform the tasks that need to be done. 
		<br><br>
		I would love to be at a place like that. If it means that I’ll have to write up another cover letter, so be it.   
		<br><br>
		Here’s to hoping that I won’t have to do that.  
		<br><br>
		Sincerely, 
		<br><br>
		Y. Kit Wu
