		I'm a senior at Harvard concentrating in Economics and minoring in Computer Science. I spoke with Brennan Rieger about LiveRamp's TERM position recently at a Harvard event, and found it to be a great fit. 
		<br><br>
		There's two particularly good reasons for that: experience and work style. 
		<br><br>
		Experience matters. I'm coming from a background of marketing roles at startups, and TERM allows me to take that experience and build on it. It allows me to take the holistic approach I had in small, well-knit teams, and apply that to the varied responsibilities of a larger organization. While it exposes me to these responsibilities, it'll also support my growth through mentorship. In the small startups I've worked for, the lack of mentorship has been a limiting factor and TERM solves that problem entirely.  
		<br><br>
		Work also matters. And fortunately, TERM comes across as a great fit for me here as well. The projects I've worked on tend to be integrated, calling for a close understanding of the product; this was true whether I was working on churn reduction, or optimizing ads across different channels. LiveRamp takes that familiarity, and challenges me to do more. It demands a holistic understanding of LiveRamp's core functions and services, and dares me to apply that knowledge in the resolution of different situations. 
		<br><br>
		I've got more to say about LiveRamp, and I'd love to go more in depth. I hope to be able to do so in person sometime in the future. Thank you for your consideration. 
		<br><br>
		Sincerely, 
		<br><br>
		Y. Kit Wu
