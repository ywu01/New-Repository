			Okay, so you're the Class Secretary. Not bad! You've secured that vaunted spot on the Commencement stage. You're looking to build a team that's adept at multiple things for the 2017 rendition of the media team. Who do you choose? 
			<br><br>
			You think about the criteria for each of the individual members: 
			<br><br>
			1.	Someone who understands HTML/CSS well. Who has experience doing web design, and can reproduce a website like the Harvard 2016 page. 
			<br>
			2.	A master photographer. 
			<br>
			3.	A designer who can do Illustrator, InDesign, or whatever that's needed to print brochures and cute dining hall table things to encourage people to do Senior Gift (let's be honest, that's what 
			we're really here for). 
			<br><br>
			But more importantly, you also want good cohesion among this team. You want the members to be vibrant, to contribute ideas as well as execute on them. You also want someone who actually cares about the SCC, because there's already a fair share of SCC detractors out there in the world (read: Senior Gift 2014). Marketing experience would be a nice bonus. 
			<br><br>
			Well guess what, Class Marshal? I have most of those things. 
			<br><br>
			1.	HTML/CSS: My CS171 final project visualized with D3, and I built ykitwu.me from scratch. Check it out - it's my portfolio site. I also A/B tested landing page designs this past summer. 
			<br>
			2.	Photography: I've been a Kirkland House photographer for years. Had an executive stint at The Crimson. Formals. Commencement. Holiday Dinners. Portraits. Biden. Faust. Scenery. <a href="http://ykitwu.me/photography/photography.html" target="_blank">Really, check it out.</a>
			<br>
			3.	Marketing: I have two years of marketing experience from internships. I'm familiar with production/distribution. 
			<br><br>
			And I'll bet you I'll contribute sufficiently as well. If conditions permit, I'd also like to embark on an artistic photo project. An effort for myself and for the community. It's why I'll be so invested.<br>
